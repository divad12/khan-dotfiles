USAGE: git review-branch <branchname> [parent -- defaults to branch.review-parent-default]

       Creates a new local branch ensuring that it's not based off master.
       This is useful as part of GitHub-style deploys. Such a branch is called
       a 'review branch'.

       All review branches should be based off a deploy branch.
       See git deploy-branch.

       If you've run 'git config --add branch.review-parent-default XXX',
       then when you run 'git review-branch foo' it will base foo off of
       the XXX branch.  You can override this behavior via
          git review-branch foo other-deploy-branch
